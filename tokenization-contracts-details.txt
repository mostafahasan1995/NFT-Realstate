TOKENIZATION MODULE CONTRACTS DETAILED ANALYSIS
=============================================

1. SMART CONTRACTS ARCHITECTURE
------------------------------
A. Core Contracts
   1. Asset Fractions Token Contract (ERC20)
      - Purpose: Represents fractional ownership of assets
      - Key Functions:
        * mint(address to, uint256 amount)
        * burn(uint256 amount)
        * transfer(address to, uint256 amount)
        * approve(address spender, uint256 amount)
        * transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
      
      - State Variables:
        * _totalSupply: Total token supply
        * _balances: Mapping of address to balance
        * _allowances: Mapping of address to spender allowances
        * _owner: Contract owner address
        * _fractions: Total number of fractions

   2. Asset Fundraising Contract
      - Purpose: Manages initial token offering
      - Key Functions:
        * startFundraising(uint256 price, uint256 duration)
        * invest(uint256 amount)
        * finalizeFundraising()
        * withdrawFunds()
      
      - State Variables:
        * _fundraisingActive: Fundraising status
        * _tokenPrice: Current token price
        * _startTime: Fundraising start time
        * _endTime: Fundraising end time
        * _totalRaised: Total funds raised

   3. Order Book Contract
      - Purpose: Manages token trading
      - Key Functions:
        * placeOrder(bool isBuy, uint256 price, uint256 amount)
        * cancelOrder(uint256 orderId)
        * executeOrder(uint256 orderId)
        * matchOrders(uint256 buyOrderId, uint256 sellOrderId)
      
      - State Variables:
        * _orders: Mapping of orderId to Order struct
        * _orderCount: Total number of orders
        * _activeOrders: Set of active order IDs

2. CONTRACT INTERACTIONS
-----------------------
A. Token Creation Flow
   ```
   [Asset Fractions Token] ←→ [Asset Fundraising]
        ↓                           ↓
   [Fractional Center] ←→ [Order Book]
   ```

   Detailed Flow:
   1. Asset Fractions Token Creation
      - Deploy ERC20 contract
      - Set initial parameters
      - Configure access controls
   
   2. Fundraising Setup
      - Link to token contract
      - Set fundraising parameters
      - Initialize price mechanism
   
   3. Order Book Integration
      - Connect to token contract
      - Set up trading parameters
      - Initialize matching engine

B. Trading Flow
   ```
   [Order Creation] → [Order Book] → [Token Transfer]
        ↓               ↓               ↓
   [Price Check] → [Matching] → [Settlement]
   ```
