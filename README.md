# GammaCitiesApi

This is a [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) project bootstrapped with [`create-nx-workspace`](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nest) workspace.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
nx serve api
```

## Extensions for VS code

1. [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) - It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more!
2. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Code formatter

## Our work flow

- main branch(protected) for production (Just maintainers can merge and pull from it)
- develop branch for development all developers can pulls from it and can sends merge request to it.
- Any issues, features or bugs it will be in a new branch created from dev branch, when task is done send merge request from the new branch into dev branch.
- If task takes more than two days you have to pull the new changes from develop branch to avoid conflicts.

### Happy coding!
